As usual, I like to document my boilerplate templates but this particular entry is especially useful to me (and hopefully to you, as well). I've been using NextJS and when I would add my local repo to Github i'd get a "Large files detected." error that ended with:
~~~
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:baguiar428/baguiar428.github.io.git'
