**Tailwind sure looks pretty**

I must confess...Up until this point working with grid/flex layout and CSS wasn't clicking. When I saw some TailwindCSS examples though, they were so nice I couldn't help but want to try it out. The talk around town was that it was pretty, but hard to setup and "harder" to use then other solutions like Bootstrap and etc. But if you learn it, it has many advantanges. Upon hearing that..I was sold and determined to dive in and get better with some tools I had struggled with until now. It seems, according to some Googling, that a recent release of React/Create React App didn't play well with Tailwind out-of-the-box but that has been resolved. I am glad I paid my dues because Tailwind is well documented, quick and powerful.

**Using Create React App and Tailwind**

I will be using "Create React App" to initialize the React app and then we will be bundling in Tailwind and other essentials for a modern React app.

First create the React app and then cd into it.

```
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```
