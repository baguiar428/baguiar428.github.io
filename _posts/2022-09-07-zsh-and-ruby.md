Abstract:
This quick how-to is meant to be a guide/reference for setting up a dev environment for Flatiron school on a Linux System (Arch/Manjaro).
The requirements were a ZSH Shell and Ruby (for using Gems). Neither of those come in a standard install of Manjaro.
I want to go over switching from a BASH to a ZSH shell and what that means plus how to setup Ruby.

Installing ZSH:
This is actually the most complicated and significant step of setting up the Flatiron dev environment.
Unless you do a lot of BASH scripting there won't be many differences on day-to-day usage between ZSH and BASH.
There are "quality of life" improvements in ZSH though that are noticeable, especially overtime. Like, more versatile tab completion and etc. (provide link for comparison).

I used OH-MY-ZSH to install ZSH.
