Hi, My name is Bruno Aguiar. Welcome to my blog page.

- I like to tinker with technology. Taking things apart and putting them back together never gets boring.
- I enjoy being in the outdoors and traveling.
- I love to snowboard and occasionally surf when I get the chance.
- Motorcycle racing (MotoGP) and motorsports are really fun.

### My story

I was born in Portugal and raised in the United States. I speak English, Portuguese, Spanish and (ein bisschen) German.
After college I moved out to Portugal to be with my girlfriend (now wife, YAY!). Since then we've moved back to the United States and havent looked back since.
I have always been into technology and worked in IT most of my professional life. I am looking to take my career 
to the next level and enrolled in the Flatiron school to become a Software Engineer. Ultimately, I'd like to become
a proficient mobile developer. This page is intended to help me log my journey as I grow and develop.
